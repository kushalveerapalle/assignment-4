1.RUBY ON RAILS :
Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a web development stack that caters to developers. It's open-source, object-oriented, and written in Ruby,
a dynamic programming language. RoR makes it easier to create lightweight applications with more flexibility.
For designing interactive user interfaces, the stack works in tandem with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as XML or JSON for data transport.
It allows web pages and database management to use default structures. It also gives a detailed 
error report for developers to use in order to create bug-free programs.


2.FLUTTER :
The next web development technology on my list is Flutter, a new web stack for cross-platform development. 
The major components are Dart, the Flutter engine, the Foundation Library, and design-specific widgets. 
Flutter is an open-source software development platform that lets you build apps for Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Web, and Linux from a single codebase.

3. MERN :
MERN is nearly identical to MEAN, with the distinction that React has taken the place of Angular.
The integration of React and its strong library, as well as the ability to utilize code on servers and browsers at the same time,
are the key benefits of using MERN. It also has excellent full-stack (frontend and backend) development capabilities. 
React makes use of JavaScript, XML, and the Virtual DOM, and these components work together to implement changes.
Because of its flexibility and performance-oriented approach, 
React is a popular framework for creating top-end single-page apps with interactive interfaces. 
The MERN technology stack is open source with strong community support and provides a powerful set of testing tools. 
It will be the second most popular web technology stack in 2021.

4. MEAN :
Experts consider MEAN technology to be the best for web development because of its multiple benefits.
This framework, which can be used to develop complex mobile and responsive online apps, 
is made up of MongoDB (a No SQL database), Express.js (a backend web framework), Angular (a front-end framework), and Node.js (an open-source cross-platform server).
The sole programming language used in this stack is JavaScript. 
It has JSON-aware components that excel at data transmission, as well as a free module library. 
This implies that rather of recreating the wheel, web developers can reuse this code across multiple projects. 
Only a basic familiarity of JavaScript is required to work with this web development technology stack. 
The stack also aids in the development of fast, efficient, and scalable software.

5.Serverless technology stack:

Developing applications on cloud infrastructure is a common web development trend these days, and if you pick it, it could be quite useful to you. 
Infrastructure management has become straightforward thanks to the services and solutions provided by serverless computing platforms.
It's straightforward to scale up to thousands of users rapidly during spikes and then scale back down when the surge subsides with the serverless technology stack. 
The first abstract platform to offer serverless computing was Google App Engine, which debuted in 2008. AWS Lambda was introduced in 2014.
